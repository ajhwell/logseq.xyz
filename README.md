# [logseq.xyz](https://logseq.xyz) - logseq self-host with github feature

This self-host [logseq](https://logseq.com) is because [logseq will deprecate the GitHub integration once the mobile app is working](https://discord.com/channels/725182569297215569/735735090784632913/861656585578086400), and this time is coming, So I create this self-hosted version of logseq.
